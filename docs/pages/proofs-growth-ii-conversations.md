## Proofs of Growth - In-organic Intelligence (II) Conversations

### Apps in II Conversations - eg "Level Up Chat" as a ChatGPT App

Brings in growth framework based on [octology](https://octology.io) e.g. skillzeb / SKILL.md, with:
- Conversation/engagement definitions (constraints) - e.g. what growth outcomes etc - time for each task e.g. 4 days minimum
- The persons situation - e.g. Growth Focus
- Crytographic Proofs of Reflection (PoR) i.e. the conversation between the person (human) and the In-organic Intelligence.
- Proofs of Reflections (e.g. Crytographic hash or zkProof) based trusting the II Agent reported back to seldriven Network Entity Interface.
